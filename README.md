# Making Connections with Natural Language Processing

This repository holds Work-In-Progress material intended for a PyCon 2016 NLP Tutorial based on [this proposal](docs/notes/proposal.md).

### [Description](docs/notes/proposal.md#description)

Do you dream of teaching your computer to read documents, chats, and web pages to extract information? Wouldn't it be cool if you could use Python to find connections between documents on your laptop or between your people's profiles and tweets on twitter? What about classifying your own writing according to topic, mood, and quality? This tutorial will teach you how to use python to do all this, creating your own personal text butler.
